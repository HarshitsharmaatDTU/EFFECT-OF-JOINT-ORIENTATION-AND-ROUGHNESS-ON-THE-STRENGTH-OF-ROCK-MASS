# EFFECT-OF-JOINT-ORIENTATION-AND-ROUGHNESS-ON-THE-STRENGTH-OF-ROCK-MASS
Experimental study on jointed rock mass behavior using gypsum plaster models with joints at 0°, 30°, and 90°, tested under uniaxial compression. Analyzed strength reduction and failure mechanisms using Mohr–Coulomb theory, Barton’s JRC, and Deere–Miller classification with applications to tunnels, slopes, and foundations.
